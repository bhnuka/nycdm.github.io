# NEX3003 (GEx New York) New York City Disparity Mapper
## Bhanuka Bandara Ekanayake

## Purpose of the Map
This project aims to visualize the systemic inequalities in New York City by highlighting disparities in public services, housing, education, policing, and demographics. By comparing data from 2011 and 2022, the map provides insights into how policies and systemic factors have influenced the distribution of resources across neighborhoods, particularly in historically marginalized communities. It serves as a tool for understanding how race, wealth, and public policy intersect to shape the urban landscape and public service access in New York City.

## Justifications for Overlays
The overlays selected for this map are designed to illuminate specific aspects of systemic inequality in New York City. Each overlay provides context for understanding the historical and contemporary factors shaping the city's disparities:

1. **Redlining**:
   - Visualizes the historical redlining maps created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC).
   - Highlights neighborhoods historically denied mortgage access due to racial composition, which has led to persistent economic and social inequalities.

2. **Black Stopped Rate**:
   - Represents the percentage of police stops involving Black individuals within each precinct.
   - Highlights the racial bias in policing practices, particularly in marginalized communities.

3. **Median Income**:
   - Shows neighborhoods based on income levels, with darker areas representing higher-income households.
   - Reflects how wealth is concentrated in predominantly white, affluent neighborhoods, influencing the quality of local public services like schools and parks.

4. **Median Home Value**:
   - Displays property values, revealing the impact of historical investment and redlining practices.
   - Higher home values correlate with wealthier neighborhoods receiving more public and private investment.

5. **College-Level Education**:
   - Indicates the percentage of residents with at least a bachelor's degree.
   - Higher educational attainment aligns with wealthier, better-served neighborhoods, illustrating disparities in long-term socioeconomic mobility.

6. **Ethnic Composition**:
   - Breaks down the racial composition of neighborhoods, showing patterns of segregation.
   - Highlights how predominantly white neighborhoods often have better access to resources compared to minority-dominated areas.

7. **Public Parks**:
   - Maps the concentration of public parks across precincts.
   - Reflects disparities in access to green spaces, with wealthier neighborhoods typically having more parks.

8. **Public Schools**:
   - Shows the number of public schools within precincts.
   - Highlights gaps in educational infrastructure, correlating with income and racial disparities.

Each of these overlays provides a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding how systemic inequality manifests across different facets of urban life in New York City. Together, they paint a comprehensive picture of how historical and structural inequities continue to shape the city's neighborhoods.
